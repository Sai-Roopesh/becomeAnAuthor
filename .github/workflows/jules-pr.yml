            You are a documentation maintainer for this BecomeAnAuthor App.
            A pull request was merged into `main` (new main commit: ${{ github.sha }}).

            Please do the following:
            1. Analyze what changed in this push to main.
            2. Update the existing docs present in the /docs directory
            3. I want you to check every file in /docs directory and update it with relevant info of the new changes
            4. Keep entries concise, factual, and date-stamped.
            5. Do not modify source code; only documentation files under /docs.
            6. Main is protected; do not push directly to `main`.
            7. Create or update a docs branch and open a pull request targeting `main` with only docs changes.
